# UTF-16 rot encryption
as my first C# project i decided to have a crack at simple text-file encryption\
included exe runs the console app, **it will overwrite the original text file** from a specified text file's filepath\
this file will be encoded with specified rot for char values\
to **decrypt the file**, enter the negative of the rot you used to encrypt it (so for example if you entered rot 3, to decrypt youd need to run the program in rot -3)
